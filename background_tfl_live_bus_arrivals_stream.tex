\subsection{Live Bus Arrivals API Stream}
\par The Live Bus Arrivals API Stream provides the predicted time until a bus is expected to arrive at a stop. These predictions are available for the next 30 minutes at any point in time. For example, at 9am, the stream will provide predicted bus arrivals up to 9.30am on the same day. This data is refreshed every 30 seconds \cite{live_bus_api_documentation}.

\par The base URL is \url{http://countdown.api.tfl.gov.uk/interfaces/ura/stream_V1}. In order to collect bus arrival data for analysis, we supplied the following parameters which specify the fields returned by the \acrshort{api}.
