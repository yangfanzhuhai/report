\chapter{Evaluation Plan}

\section{Compare predictions to real data}
We can compare the predictions generated to the live bus arrivals data stored in the arrivals table. We can calculate the standard deviation of the difference in the predicted time and actual arrival time. This value will be the direct indicator of the accuracy of the predictions.

\section{User feedback}
We can get students that take buses regularly to use the mobile application to test the accuracy of the delay predictions. The user feedback gathered will be the second input for evaluation.
