<Abstract here>
The abstract is a very brief summary of the report's contents. It should be about half a page long. Somebody unfamiliar with your project should have a good idea of what it's about having read the abstract alone and will know whether it will be of interest to them. Note that the abstract is a summary of the entire project including its conclusions. A common mistake is to provide only introductory elements in the abstract without saying what has been achieved.
