% Background
%% important because of billions of journey - high impact
In London, billions of passengers travel by bus every year. A significant number of those journeys are delayed.
%% bus delay - variabilty/uncertainty in travel time - reliability - affects passengers planning / choosing routes - need to leave more buffer time / wasted time from taking a bad route
This creates uncertainty for passengers who are forced to plan their journeys around variable bus journey timings.
We set out to provide accurate real-time predictions of bus journey timings that takes into account the situation on the ground.
% Your Approach
We collected \acrfull{tfl} bus arrival times for each bus at each stop, and computed the average historical and current bus journey time between every pair of neighbouring stops on a route.
This allows us to quantify the deviation in bus journey times from the official timetable.
% Main contributions of paper
We built a data service \acrshort{api} to provide this data in the form of historical, current, and reference bus journey times for a given hour on a given day of the week. To demonstrate the potential use of our \acrshort{api}, we designed a web application to allow passengers to browse these predicted bus journey times conveniently.
