% Problem
In London, billions of passengers travel by bus every year. Bus delay is a main concern for passengers when planning their journeys. Currently, there is no data service that provides reliable bus journey time to downstream stops.
% Your Approach - ?
\acrfull{tfl} offers data to quantify the deviation in bus journey times from the official timetable. We collected the \acrshort{tfl} live bus arrival times for each bus at each stop, and computed the average historical and current bus journey time between every pair of neighbouring stops on a route.
% Solution - ?
% Main contributions of paper
We built a data service \acrshort{api} to provide historical, current, and reference bus journey times for a given hour on a given day of the week. To demonstrate the potential use of our \acrshort{api}, we designed a web application to allow passengers to browse these predicted bus journey times conveniently.
