\todo[inline]{why does \acrshort{tfl} release open data? Find evidence}


\par \acrshort{tfl} provides free, open data consisting of around 30 feeds and \acrshort{api} \cite{open_data}.

\par There are 3 forms of data, static data files which rarely change, feeds that refreshed at regular intervals, and \acrshort{api} that enable a query to receive a bespoke response, depending on the parameters supplied.

Over 5,000 developers have registered for the open data\cite{open_data}, and around 200 travel apps are powered by it \cite{tfl_annual_report_13/14}.
