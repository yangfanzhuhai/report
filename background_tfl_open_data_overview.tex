\acrshort{tfl} provides data to quantify the delays in bus journey time. We collected the necessary data from the Live Bus Arrivals \acrshort{api}, Bus Stop Locations and Routes, and Journey Planner Bus Timetables. The Live Bus Arrivals \acrshort{api} enables a query to receive a bespoke response, depending on the parameters supplied. Bus Stop Locations and Routes come as static data files which rarely change. Journey Planner Bus Timetables are feeds that refresh at regular intervals.
