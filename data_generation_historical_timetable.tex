\section{Generating Historical Timetable}
\label{sec:historical_timetable}
\par The current timetable generated every hour is stored in a log. We processed this log by computing the average bus travel time by the start stop, end stop, day of the week, and hour of the day.

\par This computation is performed weekly on Sunday midnight to update the historical timetable.
