\subsection{Summary on Available Data}
\par While there is sufficient data on London bus network, official bus timetables, and live arrival times, there is no data service offering real-time predictions on bus delays. There is no reliable predictions estimating the travel times between any two downstream stops and the arrival times at each downstream stop from the point of real-time observation. We used these available data to create historical and current bus travel timetables, as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:data_generation}.
