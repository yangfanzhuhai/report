\subsection{Summary on Available Data}
\par While there is data of high enough granularity and detail on the London bus network including official bus timetables and live arrival times, there is no data service that integrates this to offer accurate real-time predictions incorporating bus delays. There are no reliable predictions estimating the travel times between any two downstream stops and the arrival times at each downstream stop from the point of real-time observation. We used the available data to create historical and current bus travel timetables, as discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:data_generation}.
