\subsection{Bus Stop Locations and Routes}
\label{sec:bus_sequence}
\par The \acrshort{tfl} Open Data provides network information on the location of all bus stops in London, and the sequence of bus stops in every bus route.

\par This data is in the \acrfull{csv} format. Every entry in the bus sequence file consists of information on the route number, the route direction, the sequence at which the given bus stop is positioned in the route. There is also information on the bus stop name, and bus stop codes for identification purposes.

\par We used the bus sequences as a reference when calculating the bus journey tiem. See Section \ref{sec:bus_stop_locations_routes} for details.
