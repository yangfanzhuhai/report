\chapter{Conclusion}
\par Through the course of this investigation, we have:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collected 4 months of London bus arrival times data for each bus at each stop. Computed historical and current timetables from the collected data (Chapter \ref{ch:data_generation}).
  \item Built a data service API to provide reference, historical, and current bus timetables for London buses (Chaper \ref{ch:data_service}). The timetables contain information on the average bus travel time for each downstream stop for a given route on a given day of the week and hour of the day.
  \item Designed a demonstrative web applicatoin to inform users of bus delays on a given route (Chaper \ref{ch:mobile_app}).
  \item Evaluated the accuracy of the \acrshort{tfl} Live Bus \acrshort{api} and identified that the bus arrival predictions within the future 5 minutes are on average less than 1 minute different from the acutal arrival time.
  \item Tested the performance of the data service \acrshort{api} endpoints and confirmed that the endpoints can serve 100 simultaneous users reliably.
  \item Evaluated the accuracy of the reference, historical, and current timetables provided by the data service, and built a linear regression model to produce bus journey time predictions (Chaper \ref{ch:evaluation}).
\end{enumerate}

\par We hope this project serves as a good starting point for developers to build predictive models for London bus delay, as well as useful softwares for passengers to browse the prediction timetables.
